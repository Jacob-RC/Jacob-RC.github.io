Looking at the power traces only works if and only if the device preforming encryption isn’t doing anything else. For example if the device was like your typical computer which was also doing calculations, those other actions would also influence the power consumption, rendering the power traces un-usable.\nCompared to other challenges, CPA didn’t have the most existing documentation, but of the resources that existed, they were quite helpful. In my opinion, a little too helpful. We were able to solve the challenge by using existing scripts and briefly changing the input method to follow Pico’s format. I do feel that the 300, 400 and 500 point challenges in pico shouldn’t be that simple to solve, especially with challenges like msfrog and cancri-sp.\nConclusion Overall a fun and very interesting challenge to see. I’m glad it wasn’t too mathy like many complex cryptography challenges tend to devolve into.\nThanks for reading and I hope you found something interesting.\n",

<p>The hardest and also most interesting cryptography challenge of PicoCTF 2023 involved undoing AES using a side channel attack, specifically power analysis.</p>
<p>If I&rsquo;m going to be honest, it was a pretty big surprise to see a side channel attack be the primary challenge within Pico but it was definitely a fun experience.</p>
<h1 id="solving-the-challenge">Solving the Challenge<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#solving-the-challenge">#</a></h1>
<p>The core idea of correlation power analysis (CPA) is to take the non-linear part of AES, the S-box lookup and use that bit of info to extract more information about the key.</p>
<p>In this writeup, I’m going to explain the process for solving power analysis 2 as the code and logic can be applied to power analysis 1 and warmup.</p>

<p>I feel it&rsquo;s important to note that correlation power analysis doesn&rsquo;t work in most circumstances. Looking at the power traces only works if and only if the device preforming encryption isn&rsquo;t doing anything else. For example if the device was like your typical computer which was also doing calculations, those other actions would also influence the power consumption, rendering the power traces un-usable.</p>
<p>Compared to other challenges, CPA didn&rsquo;t have the most existing documentation, but of the resources that existed, they were quite helpful. In my opinion, a little too helpful. We were able to solve the challenge by using existing scripts and briefly changing the input method to follow Pico&rsquo;s format. I do feel that the 300, 400 and 500 point challenges in  pico shouldn&rsquo;t be that simple to solve, especially with challenges like msfrog and cancri-sp.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h1>
<p>Overall a fun and very interesting challenge to see. I&rsquo;m glad it wasn&rsquo;t too mathy like many complex cryptography challenges tend to devolve into.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and I hope you found something interesting.</p>
