      <description>Preamble I&amp;rsquo;ve been a competitive card game player for a long time now; about 5 years. In that time, I&amp;rsquo;ve found a love for both the game while Iâ€™m playing, but also the other parts of the ecosystem that allow a competitive card game to function. From the design of new cards to the secondary markets that allow the competitive scene to flourish, there&amp;rsquo;s much more to card games than simply something that &amp;ldquo;kids play on the playground&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Introduction Solving the Challenge Additional Thoughts Conclusion Introduction The hardest and also most interesting cryptography challenge of PicoCTF 2023 involved undoing AES using a side channel attack, specifically power analysis.
If I&amp;rsquo;m going to be honest, it was a pretty big surprise to see a side channel attack be the primary challenge within Pico but it was definitely a fun experience.
Solving the Challenge The core idea of correlation power analysis (CPA) is to take the non-linear part of AES, the S-box lookup and use that bit of info to extract more information about the key.</description>
