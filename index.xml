      <description>Before I start, I wanted to mention how this is the 4th and last article I&amp;rsquo;m writing for Newport DECA. What started as a joke as to how I&amp;rsquo;d contribute to the DECA Debrief has become one of the many ways I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to share my passions in business with others (Credit to Songling for suggesting the great name &amp;ldquo;JC Hot Takes&amp;rdquo;). I also wanted to thank you all, the readers for taking the time and reading my articles.</description>

The Lay of the Land A Seemingly Green Light School Counselors Private Counselors (Paid) Author&amp;rsquo;s Note The Lay of the Land It’s hard to describe how much the landscape of college admissions has changed in the past 30 years.

      <description>Introduction December 1st 4 PM PST through December 3rd 5 PM PST. Those were the dates of our first cybersecurity competition.

Overall, this post hopes to discuss a bit of my thought process when making the various challenges, the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and finally end on a note of looking towards the future as a CTF player and a chall designer.</description>
